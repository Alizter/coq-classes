# A few Coq typeclasses

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tchajed/coq-simple-classes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tchajed/coq-simple-classes)

Currently has a simple `EqualDec` typeclass for decidable equality (along with an `==` notation) and `Default` for inhabited types.

This dependency is mainly so multiple projects share the same typeclass definitions.

## Installation

`git submodule add https://github.com/tchajed/coq-simple-classes vendor/simple-classes`
